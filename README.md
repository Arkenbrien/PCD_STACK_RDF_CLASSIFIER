PCD STACK RDF CLASSIFIER

PCD_STACK_CLASSIFIER.m allows for classification of LiDAR data as gravel, chipseal, grass, or foliage using an RDF. 

There are two (2) tools atm that will do parts of the main script in case of failure in the main script or some other shenanigans like idk testing

Plotter.m plots the files in the desired root directory that has a legit RESULT_EXPORT folder

Result_Exporter.m compiles the results in from a CLASSIFICATION_STACK folder in the desired root directory
